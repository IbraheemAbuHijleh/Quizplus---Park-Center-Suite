Overview
Under the supervision of Eng. Kholoud Salameh, a comprehensive suite of end-to-end test cases was developed and executed for the Quizplus Perks Center using Cypress. 
The tests covered navigation, authentication, offer accessibility, and functional interaction across the platform.

Scope

1.	Main Site Accessibility - Verified that the main URL loads correctly.

2.	Perks Center Redirection - Ensured that users can navigate to the Perks Center from the homepage.
  
4.	Offer Card Navigation - Checked that clicking an offer card updates the URL (e.g., redirects to Grammarly).
   
6.	Join Us Functionality - Verified redirection to the Sign-Up page.

7.	Offer Details Flow - Tested the full flow from "View Details" -> "Get Offer" -> Sign-Up.

8.	Direct Card Offer Flow - Tested "Card Click" -> "Get Offer" -> Sign-Up flow.

9.	Login Flow - Tested Join Us -> Login -> Check if 'Join Us' disappears after login.

10.	Offer Access After Login - Verified login followed by access to offer and visibility of the PayPal button.
    
12.	Card Offer After Login - Repeated card flow but with login step to validate consistency.

13.	Full Login and Offer Flow - Validated complete process: login from homepage -> navigate to offer -> access with PayPal button visibility.
